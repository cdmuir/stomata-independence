	abstract = {Stomata are the major gates regulating substrate availability for photosynthesis and water loss. Although both processes are critical to yield and to resource-use efficiency, we lack a comprehensive picture on how domestication and further breeding have impacted on leaf stomata. To fill this gap, stomatal sizes and densities were screened in cultivated and wild ancestor representatives of a uniquely large group of 24 herbaceous crops. Anatomical data and gasexchange models were combined to compute maximum potential conductance to water, separately for upper and lower leaf sides. The evolution of maximum conductance under domestication was diverse. Several crops increased, others decreased (noticeably high-conductance species), and others kept a similar potential conductance following domestication. It was found that the contribution of upper leaf sides to maximum conductance was statistically higher in cultivated than in wild ancestors. For crops showing this response, reduced stomatal density in the lower side of domesticated leaves was responsible for the observed ‘adaxialization’ of conductance. Increases in the size of stomata at the upper epidermis played a comparatively minor role. Nevertheless, this overall response was varied in magnitude and direction, signalling crop-wise specificities. Observed patterns reflect only potential conductances based on anatomical traits and should be used with care until actual physiological outcomes are measured. Together with advancements in the developmental genetics of stomata, our findings might hint at new breeding avenues, focused on stomata distribution. Provided urgent needs for increasing yields, the opportunities of enhancing traits of the physiological relevance of stomata should not be ignored.},

	abstract = {Stomata are essential for diffusive entry of gases to support photosynthesis, but may also expose internal leaf tissues to pathogens. To uncover trade-offs in range-wide adaptation relating to stomata, we investigated the underlying genetics of stomatal traits and linked variability in these traits with geoclimate, ecophysiology, condensed foliar tannins and pathogen susceptibility in black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). Upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) leaf stomatal traits were measured from 454 accessions collected throughout much of the species range. We calculated broad-sense heritability (H2) of stomatal traits and, using SNP data from a 34K Populus SNP array, performed a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to uncover genes underlying stomatal trait variation. H2 values for stomatal traits were moderate (average H2 = 0.33). GWAS identiﬁed genes associated primarily with adaxial stomata, including polarity genes (PHABULOSA), stomatal development genes (BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 2) and disease/wound-response genes (GLUTAMATE-CYSTEINE LIGASE). Stomatal traits correlated with latitude, gas exchange, condensed tannins and leaf rust (Melampsora) infection. Latitudinal trends of greater adaxial stomata numbers and guard cell pore size corresponded with higher stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthesis (Amax), faster shoot elongation, lower foliar tannins and greater Melampsora susceptibility. This suggests an evolutionary trade-off related to differing selection pressures across the species range. In northern environments, more adaxial stomata and larger pore sizes reﬂect selection for rapid carbon gain and growth. By contrast, southern genotypes have fewer adaxial stomata, smaller pore sizes and higher levels of condensed tannins, possibly linked to greater pressure from natural leaf pathogens, which are less signiﬁcant in northern ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Natural selection on photosynthetic performance is a primary factor determining leaf phenotypes. The complex CO2 diffusion path from substomatal cavities to the chloroplasts – the mesophyll conductance (gm) – limits photosynthetic rate in many species and hence shapes variation in leaf morphology and anatomy. Among sclerophyllous and succulent taxa, structural investment in leaves, measured as the leaf dry mass per area (LMA), has been implicated in decreased gm. However, in herbaceous taxa with high gm, it is less certain how LMA impacts CO2 diffusion and whether it signiﬁcantly affects photosynthetic performance. We addressed these questions in the context of understanding the ecophysiological signiﬁcance of leaf trait variation in wild tomatoes, a closely related group of herbaceous perennials. Although gm was high in wild tomatoes, variation in gm signiﬁcantly affected photosynthesis. Even in these tenderleaved herbaceous species, greater LMA led to reduced gm. This relationship between gm and LMA is partially mediated by cell packing and leaf thickness, although amphistomy (equal distribution of stomata on both sides of the leaf) mitigates the effect of leaf thickness. Understanding the costs of increased LMA will inform future work on the adaptive signiﬁcance of leaf trait variation across ecological gradients in wild tomatoes and other systems.},

Such information is necessary to understand plant adaptation and evolution in future rising CO2. Here, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for leaf growth, development, quality and leaf senescence were determined in a tree pedigree – an F2 hybrid of Populus trichocarpa T. \& G and Populus deltoides Marsh, following season-long exposure to either current day ambient carbon dioxide (a[CO2]) or e[CO2] at 600 mL L-1. Leaf growth and development differed between the grandparents such that P. trichocarpa showed greater response to e[CO2]. In the F2 generation, leaf development and quality traits including leaf area, leaf shape, epidermal cell area, and stomatal number, speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), and the phenology trait, canopy senescence index, were sensitive to e[CO2]. Sixty-nine QTL were mapped for the 19 traits of plants in a[CO2] while 60 QTL were mapped for plants in e[CO2]. The results suggest that although many QTL mapped to common positions in a[CO2] and e[CO2], conﬁrming their importance in determining growth, there was also differential genetic control for a number of traits including leaf senescence. Candidate genes were shown to collocate to regions where response QTL mapped. This study is the ﬁrst to identify candidate genes that may be important in determining plant adaptation to future high-CO2 world.},

	abstract = {In a previous study, important acclimation to water stress was observed in the Ramellet tomato cultivar (TR) from the Balearic Islands, related to an increase in the water-use efficiency through modifications in both stomatal (gs) and mesophyll conductances (gm). In the present work, the comparison of physiological and morphological traits between TR accessions grown with and without water stress confirmed that variability in the photosynthetic capacity was mostly explained by differences in the diffusion of CO2 through stomata and leaf mesophyll. Maximization of gm under both treatments was mainly achieved through adjustments in the mesophyll thickness and porosity and the surface area of chloroplasts exposed to intercellular airspace (Sc). In addition, the lower gm/Sc ratio for a given porosity in drought-acclimated plants suggests that the decrease in gm was due to an increased cell wall thickness. Stomatal conductance was also affected by drought-associated changes in the morphological properties of stomata, in an accession and treatment-dependent manner. The results confirm the presence of advantageous physiological traits in the response to drought stress in Mediterranean accessions of tomato, and relate them to particular changes in the leaf anatomical properties, suggesting specific adaptive processes operating at the leaf anatomical level.},

Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain the larger number of stomata in sun-leaves. These will be considered later, but we may note here the apparent discrepancy with the observations of Ziegeler that the leaves of the more xerophytic Carices possess fewer stomata than the leaves of those species characteristic of damper habitats.

            Stomata regulate the supply of CO2 for photosynthesis and the rate of water loss out of the leaf. The presence of stomata on both leaf surfaces, termed amphistomy, increases photosynthetic rate, is common in plants from high light habitats, and rare otherwise. In this study I use optimality models based on leaf energy budget and photosynthetic models to ask why amphistomy is common in high light habitats. I developed an R package leafoptimizer to solve for stomatal traits that optimally balance carbon gain with water loss in a given environment. The model predicts that amphistomy is common in high light because its marginal effect on carbon gain is greater than in the shade, but only if the costs of amphistomy are also lower under high light than in the shade. More generally, covariation between costs and benefits may explain why stomatal and other traits form discrete phenotypic clusters.},

            Gas exchange parameters and stomatal physical properties were measured in Tradescantia virginiana plants grown under well-watered conditions and treated daily with either distilled water (control) or 3.0 mm abscisic acid (ABA). Photosynthetic capacity (CO2 assimilation rate for any given leaf intercellular CO2 concentration [c  i]) and relative stomatal sensitivity to leaf-to-air vapor-pressure difference were unaffected by the ABA treatment. However, at an ambient CO2 concentration (c  a) of 350 μmol mol−1, ABA-treated plants operated with significantly lowerc  i. ABA-treated plants had significantly smaller stomata and higher stomatal density in their lower epidermis. Stomatal aperture versus guard cell pressure (P  g) characteristics measured with a cell pressure probe showed that although the form of the relationship was similar in control and ABA-treated plants, stomata of ABA-treated plants exhibited more complete closure atP  g = 0 MPa and less than half the aperture of stomata in control plants at any givenP  g. Scaling from stomatal aperture versusP  g to stomatal conductance versusP  g showed that plants grown under ABA treatment would have had significantly lower maximum stomatal conductance and would have operated with lower stomatal conductance for any given guard cell turgor. This is consistent with the observation of lower c  i/c  a in ABA-treated plants with a c  a of 350 μmol mol−1. It is proposed that the ABA-induced changes in stomatal mechanics and stomatal conductance versusP  g characteristics constitute an improvement in water-use efficiency that may be invoked under prolonged drought conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Adaptive evolution requires both raw genetic material and an accessible path of high fitness from one fitness peak to another. In this study, we used an introgression line (IL) population to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for leaf traits thought to be associated with adaptation to precipitation in wild tomatoes (Solanum sect. Lycopersicon; Solanaceae). A QTL sign test showed that several traits likely evolved under directional natural selection. Leaf traits correlated across species do not share a common genetic basis, consistent with a scenario in which selection maintains trait covariation unconstrained by pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium. Two large effect QTL for stomatal distribution colocalized with key genes in the stomatal development pathway, suggesting promising candidates for the molecular bases of adaptation in these species. Furthermore, macroevolutionary transitions between vastly different stomatal distributions may not be constrained when such large-effect mutations are available. Finally, genetic correlations between stomatal traits measured in this study and data on carbon isotope discrimination from the same ILs support a functional hypothesis that the distribution of stomata affects the resistance to CO2 diffusion inside the leaf, a trait implicated in climatic adaptation in wild tomatoes. Along with evidence from previous comparative and experimental studies, this analysis indicates that leaf traits are an important component of climatic niche adaptation in wild tomatoes and demonstrates that some trait transitions between species could have involved few, large-effect genetic changes, allowing rapid responses to new environmental conditions.},

In particular, natural selection may only favour a narrow range of adaptive optima constrained within selective regimes. Here, I integrate data with theory to test whether selection explains phenotypic constraint. A global database of 599 plant species from 94 families shows that stomatal ratio, a trait affecting photosynthesis and defence against pathogens, is highly constrained. Most plants have their stomata on the lower leaf surface (hypostomy), but species with half their stomata on each surface (amphistomy) form a distinct mode in the trait distribution. A model based on a trade-off between maximizing photosynthesis and a fitness cost of upper stomata predicts a limited number of adaptive solutions, leading to a multimodal trait distribution. Phylogenetic comparisons show that amphistomy is the most common among fast-growing species, supporting the view that CO 
              2 
              diffusion is under strong selection. These results indicate that selective optima stay within a relatively stable set of selective regimes over macroevolutionary time.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Emergent aquatic plants mostly occur in shallow waters and root in bottom substrates, but their leaves emerge from the water surface and are thus exposed to air, similar to the leaves of terrestrial plants. Previous studies have found coordination between leaf water supply and demand in terrestrial plants; however, whether such a coordination exists in emergent aquatic plants remains unknown. In this study, we analysed leaf veins and stomatal characteristics of 14 emergent aquatic and 13 terrestrial monocotyledonous herb species (EMH and TMH), with 5 EMH and 8 TMH belonging to Poaceae. We found that EMH had significantly higher mean leaf area, leaf thickness, stomatal density, stomatal number per vein length and major vein diameter, but lower mean major vein length per area (VLA) and total VLA than TMH. There was no significant difference in stomatal length, minor VLA and minor vein diameter between the two groups. Stomatal density and total VLA were positively correlated among the EMH, TMH, as well as the 8 Poaceae TMH species, but this correlation became non-significant when data from both the groups were pooled. Our results showed that the differences in water supply between emergent aquatic and terrestrial plants modify the coordination of their leaf veins and stomatal traits.},

Foliar morphology, leaf tissue organization, and various characters of stomata and trichomes were compared, using epidermal peels, cross and paradermal sections, and clearings of leaves. Pronounced anatomical differences among these closely related taxa were characterized, and effects of hybridization on the expression of anatomical features were documented. Most comparisons of parents and hybrids revealed statistically significant differences in leafsize, distribution of adaxial and abaxial stomata, and marginal and surface trichomes. In most instances hybrids demonstrated intermediate status in their foliar characters, indicating that these features are inherited from both parents. However, differences in foliar characters were usually of sufficient magnitude to allow recognition of hybrids as well as parents.},

	abstract = {Mentha (mint) is a genus in the Lamiaceae with a worldwide distribution. It has a complex classification due to frequent hybridisation at the interspecific level, variation in basic chromosome number and the occurrence of polyploidy (diploid to nonaploid). Although there have been many studies of Mentha leaf micromorphology, usually only a few taxa were described. The aim of this study was to characterise the micromorphology of Mentha leaves. Nineteen Mentha taxa, covering all four sections of the genus, were grown under controlled conditions and adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces were examined using stereo and scanning electron microscopes. This study included examination of the previously uninvestigated Australian species, M. australis and M. diemenica. The study revealed that average lamina length varied from 3 mm (M. requienii) to 34 mm (M. × niliaca) and leaves were sessile (M. spicata) to where petiole length was 50\% of total leaf length (M. requienii). Peltate and capitate glandular trichomes were found on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of almost all taxa. Most taxa were hypostomatous. A few taxa had amphistomatous leaves which was interesting given that Mentha is a mesophytic genus naturally found in moist environments beside streambanks and lake shores. Average guard cell length varied from 14 µm (M. suaveolens) to 27 µm (M. × piperita f. citrata ‘Basil’) with larger guard cell length correlated with larger DNA content and chromosome number. Two species in section Pulegium (M. requienii and M. pulegium) had small laminas, relatively long petioles and high adaxial stomatal density which distinguished them from taxa in the other three sections. Larger DNA content in plants can be associated with larger cell size. Most studies of Mentha leaf micromorphology make no mention of ploidy. The present study indicates this should be considered when comparing relative cell size between species.},

            Trait integration arises through both selection on functional coordination and shared developmental pathways. Different anatomical components must both work well and develop together to generate individuals with the appropriate physiology to survive and reproduce in their environment. In this study, we used a common garden experiment and Bayesian multilevel models to test whether stomatal anatomy coordinates leaf gas exchange, Rubisco kinetics, and leaf size across 10 closely related species of Limonium from the Balearic Islands. The results indicate that the anatomical determinants of maximum stomatal conductance, stomatal density and size, were functionally coordinated with Rubisco kinetics – species whose stomatal anatomy was correlated with low stomatal conductance have evolved Rubisco enzymes better adapted to low operational chloroplastic CO2 concentrations. Lower stomatal density was associated with greater leaf size, which can be explained by a greater proportion of pavement cells in large-leaved species. These results suggest that both selection for functional coordination (stomata and Rubisco kinetics) and shared development pathways (stomatal density and leaf area) likely shape patterns of trait integration between species.},

A numerical taxonomic study using unweighted pair-group arithmetic average clustering was performed. The phenogram was generated from 34 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) × 41 characters (four vegetative characters and the basic chromosome numbers, 16 epidermal traits and 20 reproductive characters). The epidermal microcharacters (epidermal cells, stomata, stomatal index and trichomes) are described and summarised for 18 species of Hosackia and Syrmatium, and the remaining characters were derived from the literature. Phenetic results resolved four groups of species which coincide with the new genera Acmispon, Hosackia Douglas ex Benth., Ottleya D.D.Sokoloff and Syrmatium proposed, having taken into consideration the most recent morphological and phylogenetic hypotheses.},

            The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy includes organism names and classifications for every sequence in the nucleotide and protein sequence databases of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration. Since the last review of this resource in 2012, it has undergone several improvements. Most notable is the shift from a single SQL database to a series of linked databases tied to a framework of data called NameBank. This means that relations among data elements can be adjusted in more detail, resulting in expanded annotation of synonyms, the ability to flag names with specific nomenclatural properties, enhanced tracking of publications tied to names and improved annotation of scientific authorities and types. Additionally, practices utilized by NCBI Taxonomy curators specific to major taxonomic groups are described, terms peculiar to NCBI Taxonomy are explained, external resources are acknowledged and updates to tools and other resources are documented.

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.04.25.441252},
	abstract = {The size and density of stomatal pores limit the maximum rate of leaf carbon gain and water loss ( 
            g 
            max 
            ) in land plants. Stomatal size and density are negatively correlated at broad phylogenetic scales, such that species with small stomata tend to have greater stomatal density, but the consequences of this relationship for leaf function has been controversial. The prevailing hypothesis posits that the negative scaling of size and density arises because species that evolved higher 
            g 
            max 
            also achieved reduced allocation of epidermal area to stomata (stomatal-area minimization). Alternatively, the negative scaling of size and density might reflect the maintenance of a stable mean and variance in 
            g 
            max 
            despite variation in stomatal size and density, which would result in a higher allocation of epidermal area to achieve high 
            g 
            max 
            (stomatal-area increase). Here, we tested these hypotheses by comparing their predictions for the structure of the covariance of stomatal size and density across species, applying macroevolutionary models and phylogenetic regression to data for 2408 species of angiosperms, gymnosperms, and ferns from forests worldwide. The observed stomatal size-density scaling and covariance supported the stomatal area increase hypothesis for high 
            g 
            max 
            . Thus, contrary to the prevailing view, higher 
            g 
            max 
            is not achieved while minimizing stomatal area allocation but requires increasing epidermal area allocated to stomata. Understanding of optimal stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and plant water-use efficiency used in Earth System and crop productivity models will thus be improved by including the cost of higher 
            g 
            max 
            both in construction cost of stomata and opportunity cost in epidermal space.},

She was born and lived most of her life in Russia, with most of her research focused on measuring spontaneous mutation rates in 
              Drosophila 
              . She was forced to abandon this work during the height of Lysenko's power in Russia, so she turned temporarily to the study of correlation patterns in plants; ironically, this work has had a more enduring impact than her main body of research. She showed that floral and vegetative traits become decoupled into separate correlation ‘pleiades’ in plants with specialized pollinators, but floral and vegetative traits remain correlated in plants that have less specialized pollination. Unfortunately, her plant work is often mis-cited as providing evidence for increased correlations among floral traits due to selection by pollinators for functional integration, a point she never made and one that is not supported by her data. Still, many studies of correlation pleiades have been conducted in plants, with the results mostly supporting Berg's hypothesis, although more studies on species with generalized pollination are needed.},

	abstract = {Integration and modularity refer to the patterns and processes of trait interaction and independence. Both terms have complex histories with respect to both conceptualization and quantification, resulting in a plethora of integration indices in use. We review briefly the divergent definitions, uses and measures of integration and modularity and make conceptual links to allometry. We also discuss how integration and modularity might evolve. Although integration is generally thought to be generated and maintained by correlational selection, theoretical considerations suggest the relationship is not straightforward. We caution here against uncontrolled comparisons of indices across studies. In the absence of controls for trait number, dimensionality, homology, development and function, it is difficult, or even impossible, to compare integration indices across organisms or traits. We suggest that care be invested in relating measurement to underlying theory or hypotheses, and that summative, theory-free descriptors of integration generally be avoided. The papers that follow in this Theme Issue illustrate the diversity of approaches to studying integration and modularity, highlighting strengths and pitfalls that await researchers investigating integration in plants and animals.},

	abstract = {Plant nuclear genome size (GS) varies over three orders of magnitude and is correlated with cell size and growth rate. We explore whether these relationships can be owing to geometrical scaling constraints. These would produce an isometric GS–cell volume relationship, with the GS–cell diameter relationship with the exponent of 1/3. In the GS–cell division relationship, duration of processes limited by membrane transport would scale at the 1/3 exponent, whereas those limited by metabolism would show no relationship. We tested these predictions by estimating scaling exponents from 11 published datasets on differentiated and meristematic cells in diploid herbaceous plants. We found scaling of GS–cell size to almost perfectly match the prediction. The scaling exponent of the relationship between GS and cell cycle duration did not match the prediction. However, this relationship consists of two components: (i) S phase duration, which depends on GS, and has the predicted 1/3 exponent, and (ii) a GS-independent threshold reflecting the duration of the G1 and G2 phases. The matches we found for the relationships between GS and both cell size and S phase duration are signatures of geometrical scaling. We propose that a similar approach can be used to examine GS effects at tissue and whole plant levels.},
