	abstract = {Stomata are essential for diffusive entry of gases to support photosynthesis, but may also expose internal leaf tissues to pathogens. To uncover trade-offs in range-wide adaptation relating to stomata, we investigated the underlying genetics of stomatal traits and linked variability in these traits with geoclimate, ecophysiology, condensed foliar tannins and pathogen susceptibility in black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). Upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) leaf stomatal traits were measured from 454 accessions collected throughout much of the species range. We calculated broad-sense heritability (H2) of stomatal traits and, using SNP data from a 34K Populus SNP array, performed a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to uncover genes underlying stomatal trait variation. H2 values for stomatal traits were moderate (average H2 = 0.33). GWAS identiﬁed genes associated primarily with adaxial stomata, including polarity genes (PHABULOSA), stomatal development genes (BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 2) and disease/wound-response genes (GLUTAMATE-CYSTEINE LIGASE). Stomatal traits correlated with latitude, gas exchange, condensed tannins and leaf rust (Melampsora) infection. Latitudinal trends of greater adaxial stomata numbers and guard cell pore size corresponded with higher stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthesis (Amax), faster shoot elongation, lower foliar tannins and greater Melampsora susceptibility. This suggests an evolutionary trade-off related to differing selection pressures across the species range. In northern environments, more adaxial stomata and larger pore sizes reﬂect selection for rapid carbon gain and growth. By contrast, southern genotypes have fewer adaxial stomata, smaller pore sizes and higher levels of condensed tannins, possibly linked to greater pressure from natural leaf pathogens, which are less signiﬁcant in northern ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Stomata are the major gates regulating substrate availability for photosynthesis and water loss. Although both processes are critical to yield and to resource-use efficiency, we lack a comprehensive picture on how domestication and further breeding have impacted on leaf stomata. To fill this gap, stomatal sizes and densities were screened in cultivated and wild ancestor representatives of a uniquely large group of 24 herbaceous crops. Anatomical data and gasexchange models were combined to compute maximum potential conductance to water, separately for upper and lower leaf sides. The evolution of maximum conductance under domestication was diverse. Several crops increased, others decreased (noticeably high-conductance species), and others kept a similar potential conductance following domestication. It was found that the contribution of upper leaf sides to maximum conductance was statistically higher in cultivated than in wild ancestors. For crops showing this response, reduced stomatal density in the lower side of domesticated leaves was responsible for the observed ‘adaxialization’ of conductance. Increases in the size of stomata at the upper epidermis played a comparatively minor role. Nevertheless, this overall response was varied in magnitude and direction, signalling crop-wise specificities. Observed patterns reflect only potential conductances based on anatomical traits and should be used with care until actual physiological outcomes are measured. Together with advancements in the developmental genetics of stomata, our findings might hint at new breeding avenues, focused on stomata distribution. Provided urgent needs for increasing yields, the opportunities of enhancing traits of the physiological relevance of stomata should not be ignored.},

	abstract = {Natural selection on photosynthetic performance is a primary factor determining leaf phenotypes. The complex CO2 diffusion path from substomatal cavities to the chloroplasts – the mesophyll conductance (gm) – limits photosynthetic rate in many species and hence shapes variation in leaf morphology and anatomy. Among sclerophyllous and succulent taxa, structural investment in leaves, measured as the leaf dry mass per area (LMA), has been implicated in decreased gm. However, in herbaceous taxa with high gm, it is less certain how LMA impacts CO2 diffusion and whether it signiﬁcantly affects photosynthetic performance. We addressed these questions in the context of understanding the ecophysiological signiﬁcance of leaf trait variation in wild tomatoes, a closely related group of herbaceous perennials. Although gm was high in wild tomatoes, variation in gm signiﬁcantly affected photosynthesis. Even in these tenderleaved herbaceous species, greater LMA led to reduced gm. This relationship between gm and LMA is partially mediated by cell packing and leaf thickness, although amphistomy (equal distribution of stomata on both sides of the leaf) mitigates the effect of leaf thickness. Understanding the costs of increased LMA will inform future work on the adaptive signiﬁcance of leaf trait variation across ecological gradients in wild tomatoes and other systems.},

Lack of evidence leads to circular-sounding reasoning: “this trait was shaped by selection in unseen ancestral populations and this selection must have occurred because the trait is present.” Well-supported adaptationist explanations include evidence that is not only abundant but selected from comparative, populational, and optimality perspectives, the three adaptationist subdisciplines. Each subdiscipline obtains its broad relevance in evolutionary biology via assumptions that can only be tested with the methods of the other subdisciplines. However, even in the best-supported explanations, assumptions regarding variation, heritability, and ﬁtness in unseen ancestral populations are always present. These assumptions are accepted given how well they would explain the data if they were true. This means that some degree of “circularity” is present in all evolutionary explanations. Evolutionary explanation corresponds not to a deductive structure, as biologists usually assert, but instead to ones such as abduction or Bayesianism. With these structures in mind, we show the way to a healthier view of “circularity” in evolutionary biology and why integration across the comparative, populational, and optimality approaches is necessary.},

Hydraulic optimality models suggest that vessels should widen predictably from stem tip to base, buffering hydrodynamic resistance accruing as stems, and therefore conductive path, increase in length. Data from 257 species (609 samples) show that vessels widen as predicted with distance from the stem apex across angiosperm orders, habits and habitats. Standardising for stem length, vessels are only slightly wider in warm/moist climates and in lianas, showing that, rather than climate or habit, plant size is by far the main driver of global variation in mean vessel diameter. Terminal twig vessels become wider as plant height increases, while vessel density decreases slightly less than expected tip to base. These patterns lead to testable predictions regarding evolutionary strategies allowing plants to minimise carbon costs per unit leaf area even as height increases.},

	abstract = {Limited information is available on the genetic variation and control for plant growth response to elevated CO2 (e[CO2]). Such information is necessary to understand plant adaptation and evolution in future rising CO2. Here, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for leaf growth, development, quality and leaf senescence were determined in a tree pedigree – an F2 hybrid of Populus trichocarpa T. \& G and Populus deltoides Marsh, following season-long exposure to either current day ambient carbon dioxide (a[CO2]) or e[CO2] at 600 mL L-1. Leaf growth and development differed between the grandparents such that P. trichocarpa showed greater response to e[CO2]. In the F2 generation, leaf development and quality traits including leaf area, leaf shape, epidermal cell area, and stomatal number, speciﬁc leaf area (SLA), and the phenology trait, canopy senescence index, were sensitive to e[CO2]. Sixty-nine QTL were mapped for the 19 traits of plants in a[CO2] while 60 QTL were mapped for plants in e[CO2]. The results suggest that although many QTL mapped to common positions in a[CO2] and e[CO2], conﬁrming their importance in determining growth, there was also differential genetic control for a number of traits including leaf senescence. Candidate genes were shown to collocate to regions where response QTL mapped. This study is the ﬁrst to identify candidate genes that may be important in determining plant adaptation to future high-CO2 world.},

A total of 285 previously published SD and 145 SI responses to variable CO2 concentrations from a pool of 176 C3 plant species are analyzed here to test the reliability of this method. The percentage of responses inversely responding to CO2 rises from 40 and 36\% (for SD and SI, respectively) in experimental studies to 88 and 94\% (for SD and SI, respectively) in fossil studies. The inconsistent experimental responses verify previous concerns involving this method, however the high percentage of fossil responses showing an inverse relationship clearly validates the method when applied over time scales of similar length. Furthermore, for all groups of observations, a positive relationship between CO2 and SD/SI is found in only \#12\% of cases. Thus, CO2 appears to inversely affect stomatal initiation, although the mechanism may involve genetic adaptation and therefore is often not clearly expressed under short CO2 exposure times.},

	abstract = {In a previous study, important acclimation to water stress was observed in the Ramellet tomato cultivar (TR) from the Balearic Islands, related to an increase in the water-use efficiency through modifications in both stomatal (gs) and mesophyll conductances (gm). In the present work, the comparison of physiological and morphological traits between TR accessions grown with and without water stress confirmed that variability in the photosynthetic capacity was mostly explained by differences in the diffusion of CO2 through stomata and leaf mesophyll. Maximization of gm under both treatments was mainly achieved through adjustments in the mesophyll thickness and porosity and the surface area of chloroplasts exposed to intercellular airspace (Sc). In addition, the lower gm/Sc ratio for a given porosity in drought-acclimated plants suggests that the decrease in gm was due to an increased cell wall thickness. Stomatal conductance was also affected by drought-associated changes in the morphological properties of stomata, in an accession and treatment-dependent manner. The results confirm the presence of advantageous physiological traits in the response to drought stress in Mediterranean accessions of tomato, and relate them to particular changes in the leaf anatomical properties, suggesting specific adaptive processes operating at the leaf anatomical level.},

If three of these parameters are considered at a time, the spectrum of possible shell forms may be shown by a block diagram. Analog and digital computer constructions make it possible to visualize shell forms that are theoretically possible but do not occur in nature. Actual species are not randomly distributed in the total spectrum of theoretically possible forms. Functional and evolutionary groups are confined to discrete regions of the spectum. Rational explanations for several of the observed distributions are apparent and may be expressed in terms of shell function. For example, a bivalve must have non-overlapping whorls in order to have a functional hinge. This fact restricts the geometric range of both brachiopods and bivalved molluscs. Ontogenetic change in coiling geometry may be interpreted as a compensation for the effects of increase in absolute size during growth.},

            The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy includes organism names and classifications for every sequence in the nucleotide and protein sequence databases of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration. Since the last review of this resource in 2012, it has undergone several improvements. Most notable is the shift from a single SQL database to a series of linked databases tied to a framework of data called NameBank. This means that relations among data elements can be adjusted in more detail, resulting in expanded annotation of synonyms, the ability to flag names with specific nomenclatural properties, enhanced tracking of publications tied to names and improved annotation of scientific authorities and types. Additionally, practices utilized by NCBI Taxonomy curators specific to major taxonomic groups are described, terms peculiar to NCBI Taxonomy are explained, external resources are acknowledged and updates to tools and other resources are documented.

	abstract = {Raissa L. Berg had a remarkable career in many respects and an impact on the study of phenotypic integration that continues to increase over 50 years after the publication of her seminal paper in that area. She was born and lived most of her life in Russia, with most of her research focused on measuring spontaneous mutation rates in 
              Drosophila 
              . She was forced to abandon this work during the height of Lysenko's power in Russia, so she turned temporarily to the study of correlation patterns in plants; ironically, this work has had a more enduring impact than her main body of research. She showed that floral and vegetative traits become decoupled into separate correlation ‘pleiades’ in plants with specialized pollinators, but floral and vegetative traits remain correlated in plants that have less specialized pollination. Unfortunately, her plant work is often mis-cited as providing evidence for increased correlations among floral traits due to selection by pollinators for functional integration, a point she never made and one that is not supported by her data. Still, many studies of correlation pleiades have been conducted in plants, with the results mostly supporting Berg's hypothesis, although more studies on species with generalized pollination are needed.},

Both terms have complex histories with respect to both conceptualization and quantification, resulting in a plethora of integration indices in use. We review briefly the divergent definitions, uses and measures of integration and modularity and make conceptual links to allometry. We also discuss how integration and modularity might evolve. Although integration is generally thought to be generated and maintained by correlational selection, theoretical considerations suggest the relationship is not straightforward. We caution here against uncontrolled comparisons of indices across studies. In the absence of controls for trait number, dimensionality, homology, development and function, it is difficult, or even impossible, to compare integration indices across organisms or traits. We suggest that care be invested in relating measurement to underlying theory or hypotheses, and that summative, theory-free descriptors of integration generally be avoided. The papers that follow in this Theme Issue illustrate the diversity of approaches to studying integration and modularity, highlighting strengths and pitfalls that await researchers investigating integration in plants and animals.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Gas exchange parameters and stomatal physical properties were measured in Tradescantia virginiana plants grown under well-watered conditions and treated daily with either distilled water (control) or 3.0 mm abscisic acid (ABA). Photosynthetic capacity (CO2 assimilation rate for any given leaf intercellular CO2 concentration [c  i]) and relative stomatal sensitivity to leaf-to-air vapor-pressure difference were unaffected by the ABA treatment. However, at an ambient CO2 concentration (c  a) of 350 μmol mol−1, ABA-treated plants operated with significantly lowerc  i. ABA-treated plants had significantly smaller stomata and higher stomatal density in their lower epidermis. Stomatal aperture versus guard cell pressure (P  g) characteristics measured with a cell pressure probe showed that although the form of the relationship was similar in control and ABA-treated plants, stomata of ABA-treated plants exhibited more complete closure atP  g = 0 MPa and less than half the aperture of stomata in control plants at any givenP  g. Scaling from stomatal aperture versusP  g to stomatal conductance versusP  g showed that plants grown under ABA treatment would have had significantly lower maximum stomatal conductance and would have operated with lower stomatal conductance for any given guard cell turgor. This is consistent with the observation of lower c  i/c  a in ABA-treated plants with a c  a of 350 μmol mol−1. It is proposed that the ABA-induced changes in stomatal mechanics and stomatal conductance versusP  g characteristics constitute an improvement in water-use efficiency that may be invoked under prolonged drought conditions.},

	abstract = {The size and density of stomatal pores limit the maximum rate of leaf carbon gain and water loss ( 
            g 
            max 
            ) in land plants. Stomatal size and density are negatively correlated at broad phylogenetic scales, such that species with small stomata tend to have greater stomatal density, but the consequences of this relationship for leaf function has been controversial. The prevailing hypothesis posits that the negative scaling of size and density arises because species that evolved higher 
            g 
            max 
            also achieved reduced allocation of epidermal area to stomata (stomatal-area minimization). Alternatively, the negative scaling of size and density might reflect the maintenance of a stable mean and variance in 
            g 
            max 
            despite variation in stomatal size and density, which would result in a higher allocation of epidermal area to achieve high 
            g 
            max 
            (stomatal-area increase). Here, we tested these hypotheses by comparing their predictions for the structure of the covariance of stomatal size and density across species, applying macroevolutionary models and phylogenetic regression to data for 2408 species of angiosperms, gymnosperms, and ferns from forests worldwide. The observed stomatal size-density scaling and covariance supported the stomatal area increase hypothesis for high 
            g 
            max 
            . Thus, contrary to the prevailing view, higher 
            g 
            max 
            is not achieved while minimizing stomatal area allocation but requires increasing epidermal area allocated to stomata. Understanding of optimal stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and plant water-use efficiency used in Earth System and crop productivity models will thus be improved by including the cost of higher 
            g 
            max 
            both in construction cost of stomata and opportunity cost in epidermal space.},

	abstract = {Ecologically important traits do not evolve without limits. Instead, evolution is constrained by the set of available and viable phenotypes. In particular, natural selection may only favour a narrow range of adaptive optima constrained within selective regimes. Here, I integrate data with theory to test whether selection explains phenotypic constraint. A global database of 599 plant species from 94 families shows that stomatal ratio, a trait affecting photosynthesis and defence against pathogens, is highly constrained. Most plants have their stomata on the lower leaf surface (hypostomy), but species with half their stomata on each surface (amphistomy) form a distinct mode in the trait distribution. A model based on a trade-off between maximizing photosynthesis and a fitness cost of upper stomata predicts a limited number of adaptive solutions, leading to a multimodal trait distribution. Phylogenetic comparisons show that amphistomy is the most common among fast-growing species, supporting the view that CO 
              2 
              diffusion is under strong selection. These results indicate that selective optima stay within a relatively stable set of selective regimes over macroevolutionary time.},

	abstract = {Plant nuclear genome size (GS) varies over three orders of magnitude and is correlated with cell size and growth rate. We explore whether these relationships can be owing to geometrical scaling constraints. These would produce an isometric GS–cell volume relationship, with the GS–cell diameter relationship with the exponent of 1/3. In the GS–cell division relationship, duration of processes limited by membrane transport would scale at the 1/3 exponent, whereas those limited by metabolism would show no relationship. We tested these predictions by estimating scaling exponents from 11 published datasets on differentiated and meristematic cells in diploid herbaceous plants. We found scaling of GS–cell size to almost perfectly match the prediction. The scaling exponent of the relationship between GS and cell cycle duration did not match the prediction. However, this relationship consists of two components: (i) S phase duration, which depends on GS, and has the predicted 1/3 exponent, and (ii) a GS-independent threshold reflecting the duration of the G1 and G2 phases. The matches we found for the relationships between GS and both cell size and S phase duration are signatures of geometrical scaling. We propose that a similar approach can be used to examine GS effects at tissue and whole plant levels.},

Studies on the “sun” and “shade” leaves of woodland plants brought to light the striking differences which the numerical frequency of stomata may exhibit in leaves of the same species when growing in different environments and even in different leaves of the same individual. Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain the larger number of stomata in sun-leaves. These will be considered later, but we may note here the apparent discrepancy with the observations of Ziegeler that the leaves of the more xerophytic Carices possess fewer stomata than the leaves of those species characteristic of damper habitats.

            Stomata regulate the supply of CO2 for photosynthesis and the rate of water loss out of the leaf. The presence of stomata on both leaf surfaces, termed amphistomy, increases photosynthetic rate, is common in plants from high light habitats, and rare otherwise. In this study I use optimality models based on leaf energy budget and photosynthetic models to ask why amphistomy is common in high light habitats. I developed an R package leafoptimizer to solve for stomatal traits that optimally balance carbon gain with water loss in a given environment. The model predicts that amphistomy is common in high light because its marginal effect on carbon gain is greater than in the shade, but only if the costs of amphistomy are also lower under high light than in the shade. More generally, covariation between costs and benefits may explain why stomatal and other traits form discrete phenotypic clusters.},

            Adaptive evolution requires both raw genetic material and an accessible path of high fitness from one fitness peak to another. In this study, we used an introgression line (IL) population to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for leaf traits thought to be associated with adaptation to precipitation in wild tomatoes (Solanum sect. Lycopersicon; Solanaceae). A QTL sign test showed that several traits likely evolved under directional natural selection. Leaf traits correlated across species do not share a common genetic basis, consistent with a scenario in which selection maintains trait covariation unconstrained by pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium. Two large effect QTL for stomatal distribution colocalized with key genes in the stomatal development pathway, suggesting promising candidates for the molecular bases of adaptation in these species. Furthermore, macroevolutionary transitions between vastly different stomatal distributions may not be constrained when such large-effect mutations are available. Finally, genetic correlations between stomatal traits measured in this study and data on carbon isotope discrimination from the same ILs support a functional hypothesis that the distribution of stomata affects the resistance to CO2 diffusion inside the leaf, a trait implicated in climatic adaptation in wild tomatoes. Along with evidence from previous comparative and experimental studies, this analysis indicates that leaf traits are an important component of climatic niche adaptation in wild tomatoes and demonstrates that some trait transitions between species could have involved few, large-effect genetic changes, allowing rapid responses to new environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Emergent aquatic plants mostly occur in shallow waters and root in bottom substrates, but their leaves emerge from the water surface and are thus exposed to air, similar to the leaves of terrestrial plants. Previous studies have found coordination between leaf water supply and demand in terrestrial plants; however, whether such a coordination exists in emergent aquatic plants remains unknown. In this study, we analysed leaf veins and stomatal characteristics of 14 emergent aquatic and 13 terrestrial monocotyledonous herb species (EMH and TMH), with 5 EMH and 8 TMH belonging to Poaceae. We found that EMH had significantly higher mean leaf area, leaf thickness, stomatal density, stomatal number per vein length and major vein diameter, but lower mean major vein length per area (VLA) and total VLA than TMH. There was no significant difference in stomatal length, minor VLA and minor vein diameter between the two groups. Stomatal density and total VLA were positively correlated among the EMH, TMH, as well as the 8 Poaceae TMH species, but this correlation became non-significant when data from both the groups were pooled. Our results showed that the differences in water supply between emergent aquatic and terrestrial plants modify the coordination of their leaf veins and stomatal traits.},

Foliar morphology, leaf tissue organization, and various characters of stomata and trichomes were compared, using epidermal peels, cross and paradermal sections, and clearings of leaves. Pronounced anatomical differences among these closely related taxa were characterized, and effects of hybridization on the expression of anatomical features were documented. Most comparisons of parents and hybrids revealed statistically significant differences in leafsize, distribution of adaxial and abaxial stomata, and marginal and surface trichomes. In most instances hybrids demonstrated intermediate status in their foliar characters, indicating that these features are inherited from both parents. However, differences in foliar characters were usually of sufficient magnitude to allow recognition of hybrids as well as parents.},

	abstract = {Mentha (mint) is a genus in the Lamiaceae with a worldwide distribution. It has a complex classification due to frequent hybridisation at the interspecific level, variation in basic chromosome number and the occurrence of polyploidy (diploid to nonaploid). Although there have been many studies of Mentha leaf micromorphology, usually only a few taxa were described. The aim of this study was to characterise the micromorphology of Mentha leaves. Nineteen Mentha taxa, covering all four sections of the genus, were grown under controlled conditions and adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces were examined using stereo and scanning electron microscopes. This study included examination of the previously uninvestigated Australian species, M. australis and M. diemenica. The study revealed that average lamina length varied from 3 mm (M. requienii) to 34 mm (M. × niliaca) and leaves were sessile (M. spicata) to where petiole length was 50\% of total leaf length (M. requienii). Peltate and capitate glandular trichomes were found on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of almost all taxa. Most taxa were hypostomatous. A few taxa had amphistomatous leaves which was interesting given that Mentha is a mesophytic genus naturally found in moist environments beside streambanks and lake shores. Average guard cell length varied from 14 µm (M. suaveolens) to 27 µm (M. × piperita f. citrata ‘Basil’) with larger guard cell length correlated with larger DNA content and chromosome number. Two species in section Pulegium (M. requienii and M. pulegium) had small laminas, relatively long petioles and high adaxial stomatal density which distinguished them from taxa in the other three sections. Larger DNA content in plants can be associated with larger cell size. Most studies of Mentha leaf micromorphology make no mention of ploidy. The present study indicates this should be considered when comparing relative cell size between species.},

            Trait integration arises through both selection on functional coordination and shared developmental pathways. Different anatomical components must both work well and develop together to generate individuals with the appropriate physiology to survive and reproduce in their environment. In this study, we used a common garden experiment and Bayesian multilevel models to test whether stomatal anatomy coordinates leaf gas exchange, Rubisco kinetics, and leaf size across 10 closely related species of Limonium from the Balearic Islands. The results indicate that the anatomical determinants of maximum stomatal conductance, stomatal density and size, were functionally coordinated with Rubisco kinetics – species whose stomatal anatomy was correlated with low stomatal conductance have evolved Rubisco enzymes better adapted to low operational chloroplastic CO2 concentrations. Lower stomatal density was associated with greater leaf size, which can be explained by a greater proportion of pavement cells in large-leaved species. These results suggest that both selection for functional coordination (stomata and Rubisco kinetics) and shared development pathways (stomatal density and leaf area) likely shape patterns of trait integration between species.},

Phenetic results resolved four groups of species which coincide with the new genera Acmispon, Hosackia Douglas ex Benth., Ottleya D.D.Sokoloff and Syrmatium proposed, having taken into consideration the most recent morphological and phylogenetic hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Rice (
              Oryza sativa
              L.) is the most important food crop in the world and a model system for plant biology. With the completion of a finished genome sequence we must now functionally characterize the rice genome by a variety of methods, including comparative genomic analysis between cereal species and within the genus
              Oryza. Oryza
              contains two cultivated and 22 wild species that represent 10 distinct genome types. The wild species contain an essentially untapped reservoir of agriculturally important genes that must be harnessed if we are to maintain a safe and secure food supply for the 21st century. As a first step to functionally characterize the rice genome from a comparative standpoint, we report the construction and analysis of a comprehensive set of 12 BAC libraries that represent the 10 genome types of
              Oryza
              . To estimate the number of clones required to generate 10 genome equivalent BAC libraries we determined the genome sizes of nine of the 12 species using flow cytometry. Each library represents a minimum of 10 genome equivalents, has an average insert size range between 123 and 161 kb, an average organellar content of 0.4\%–4.1\% and nonrecombinant content between 0\% and 5\%. Genome coverage was estimated mathematically and empirically by hybridization and extensive contig and BAC end sequence analysis. A preliminary analysis of BAC end sequences of clones from these libraries indicated that LTR retrotransposons are the predominant class of repeat elements in
              Oryza
              and a roughly linear relationship of these elements with genome size was observed.},

Here, we report accurate estimates of genome size in 99 accessions from 26 species of Avena. We demonstrate that the average genome size of C genome diploid species (2C = 10.26 pg) is 15\% larger than that of A genome species (2C = 8.95 pg), and that this difference likely accounts for a progression of size among tetraploid species, where AB {\textless} AC {\textless} CC (average 2C = 16.76, 18.60, and 21.78 pg, respectively). All accessions from three hexaploid species with the ACD genome configuration had similar genome sizes (average 2C = 25.74 pg). Genome size was mostly consistent within species and in general agreement with current information about evolutionary distance among species. Results also suggest that most of the polyploid species in Avena have experienced genome downsizing in relation to their diploid progenitors. Genome size measurements could provide additional quality control for species identification in germplasm collections, especially in cases where diploid and polyploid species have similar morphology.},

	abstract = {Penstemon is the largest genus in North America with more than 270 reported species. However, little is known about its genome size. This information may be useful in developing hybrids for landscape use and for gaining insight into its current taxonomy. Using flow cytometry, we estimated the genome size of approximately 40\% of the genus (115 accessions from 105 different species). Genome sizes for both reported and probable diploids range from P. dissectus 2C = 0.94 pg (1C = 462 Mbp) to P. pachyphyllus var. mucronatus 2C = 1.88 pg (1C = 919 Mbp), and the polyploids range from P. attenuatus var. attenuatus 2C = 2.35 pg (1C = 1148 Mbp) to P. digitalis 2C = 6.45 pg (1C = 3152 Mbp). Chromosome counts were done for ten previously published and four previously unreported Penstemon species (P. dissectus, P. navajoa , P. caespitosus var. desertipicti, and P. ramaleyi ). These counts were compiled with all previously published chromosome data and compared with the flow cytometry results. Ploidy within this study ranged from diploid to dodecaploid. These data were compared and contrasted with the current taxonomy of Penstemon and previously published internal transcribed spacer and chloroplast DNA phylogenetic work. Based on genome size and previous studies, reassigning P. montanus to the subgenus Penstemon and P. personatus to the subgenus Dasanthera, would better reflect the phylogeny of the genus. Furthermore, our data concur with previous studies suggesting that the subgenus Habroanthus be included in the subgenus Penstemon. The DNA content of subgenus Penstemon exhibits high plasticity and spans a sixfold increase from the smallest to the largest genome ( P. linarioides subsp. sileri and P. digitalis, respectively). Our study found flow cytometry to be useful in species identification and verification.},

	abstract = {In 23 species of Papaver L., 2C nuclear DNA amounts range from 4.64 pg in Papaver persicum (2n = 14) to 22.43 pg in Papaver orientale (2n = 42), revealing a fivefold variation within the genus. However, such variation is limited to only twofold among the species that have the same chromosome number (2n = 14). The distribution of DNA is discontinuously spread over six groups in the genus. A strong positive correlation exists between nuclear DNA content and metaphase chromosome length. Viewed in the context of evolutionary divergence, it is revealed that DNA reduction has taken place in conjunction with speciation. This is achieved by equal reduction to each chromosome independent of chromosome size, as apparent from the estimated DNA values for individual chromosomes within the complements. The diminution in DNA amount with evolutionary specialisation appears to be a genomic strategy to dispense with the less important DNA associated with heterochromatic segments. The uniform distribution of such dispensible DNA throughout the complement is probably nucleotypically conducive to allow the genomic loss to be adaptationally operative, lest it affects the very survival of the evolving species.Key words: Papaver, evolution, DNA content, DNA systematics.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the nuclear DNA content estimates obtained by flow cytometry for a group of twelve Eucalyptus species and five fast-growing hybrids that includes those most widely planted throughout the world. Estimates of nuclear (2C) DNA content for the species surveyed ranged from 0.77 pg/2C for Eucalyptuscitriodora Hook. (subgenus Corymbia) to 1.47 pg/2C for Eucalyptussaligna Smith (subgenus Symphyomyrtus). This range corresponds to a haploid genome size range of 370–700 megabase pairs. The average physical equivalent of a 1 cM distance could be as low as 200 kilobase pairs in Eucalyptus, an attractive feature for positional cloning efforts in woody plants. The closer the species were in phylogenetic relationship the more similar were their nuclear DNA content values. All the interspecific hybrids surveyed displayed a nuclear DNA content in the expected intermediate range between the respective parental species, with the exception of one originating from Rio Claro, Brazil, whose exact parentage is unknown. No evidence of polyploidy was observed in any of the hybrids. The flow cytometry procedure employed in this study is an efficient method for investigating ploidy levels of high yielding hybrids of Eucalyptus.},

Blake (1.33 pg and 1.34 pg, respectively), whereas E. globulus Labill. presented distinct mean values (1.09, 1.13 and 1.40). These differences have been attributed to the different methodological approach, utilised plant cultivar and presence of intrinsic metabolic compounds that affect fluorochrome fluorescence. In the present study, a FCM and image cytometry (ICM) design, following international consensus criteria, were adopted to reassess the nuclear DNA contents of the above-mentioned Eucalyptus species. Statistical analyses revealed either similar or discrepant nuclear DNA contents, depending on the standard species used and whether FCM or ICM was employed. Our results demonstrated that 2C DNA values obtained by FCM and ICM were most uniform when Solanum lycopersicum was used as a standard. Moreover, the values obtained for E. grandis and E. urophylla were close, but differed as much as 24.63\% in relation to previous data, and E. globulus proportionally varied up to 25\%. New DNA content values are suggested for these eucalypt species.},

No attempt is made to reconsider those aspects of nuclear DNA estimation which have been fully revised previously, although the bibliography of such aspects is given. Instead, the paper is intended as a source of basic information regarding the terminology, practice and limitations of nuclear DNA estimation, especially by Feulgen microdensitometry, as currently practiced.},

The idiogram of L. coimbrensis differed markedly from those for the species of the L. corniculatus group, which were considerably more uniform. Lotus pedunculatus was the only species with chromosomes bearing satellites. Since L. corniculatus has a somatic chromosome number of 24, compared to L. corniculatus var. brachyodon with 12, the latter represents a new diploid taxon which should receive further taxonomic study. DNA values differed between the species, and in general, total complement lengths were correlated with DNA values. It is suggested that classical karyotype analysis may not be a suitable method to investigate the parentage of the tetraploid, L. corniculatus, because of chromosomal repatterning which has occurred during the evolutionary development of the closely related diploid species.},

	abstract = {Many components of cell and nuclear size and mass are correlated with nuclear DNA content in plants, as also are the durations and rates of such developmental processes as mitosis and meiosis. It is suggested that the multiple effects of the mass of nuclear DNA which affect all cells and apply throughout the life of the plant can together determine the minimum generation time for each species. The durations of mitosis and of meiosis are both positively correlated with nuclear DNA content and, therefore, species with a short minimum generation time might be expected to have a shorter mean cell cycle time and mean meiotic duration, and a lower mean nuclear DNA content, than species with a long mean minimum generation time. In tests of this hypothesis, using data collated from the literature, it is shown that the mean cell cycle time and the mean meiotic duration in annual species is significantly shorter than in perennial species. Furthermore, the mean nuclear DNA content of annual species is significantly lower than for perennial species both in dicotyledons and monocotyledons. Ephemeral species have a significantly lower mean nuclear DNA content than annual species. Among perennial monocotyledons the mean nuclear DNA content of species which can complete a life cycle within one year (facultative perennials) is significantly lower than the mean nuclear DNA content of those which cannot (obligate perennials). However, the mean nuclear DNA content of facultative perennials does not differ significantly from the mean for annual species. It is suggested that the effects of nuclear DNA content on the duration of developmental processes are most obvious during its determinant stages, and that the largest effects of nuclear DNA mass are expressed at times when development is slowest, for instance, during meiosis or at low temperature. It has been suggested that DNA influences development in two ways, directly through its informational content, and indirectly by the physical-mechanical effects of its mass. The term 'nucleotype' is used to describe those conditions of the nucleus which effect the phenotype independently of the informational content of the DNA. It is suggested that cell cycle time, meiotic duration, and minimum generation time are determined by the nucleotype. In addition, it may be that satellite DNA is significant in its nucleotypic effects on developmental processes.},

	abstract = {The genome sizes of a Begonia collection comprising 37 species and 23 hybrids of African, Asiatic, Middle American, and South American origin were screened using flow cytometry. Within the collection, 1C values varied between 0.23 and 1.46 pg DNA. Genome sizes were, in most cases, not positively correlated with chromosome number, but with pollen size. A 12-fold difference in mean chromosome size was found between the genotypes with the largest and smallest chromosomes. In general, chromosomes from South American genotypes were smaller than chromosomes of African, Asian, or Middle American genotypes, except for B. boliviensis and B. pearcei. Cytological chromosome studies in different genotypes showed variable chromosome numbers, length, width, and total chromosome volume, which confirmed the diversity in genome size. Large secondary constrictions were present in several investigated genotypes. These data show that chromosome number and structure exhibit a great deal of variation within the genus Begonia, and likely help to explain the large number of taxa found within the genus.},

	abstract = {The Death Valley at Žerjav in northern Slovenia exhibits a gradient of heavy metal pollution in the soil with severe consequences for species richness and composition along this gradient. Recently, a progressive loss of large-genome species in parallel with increasing concentrations of heavy metals has been shown. Here, we have measured the genome size of a near-complete sample of these species with flow cytometry and analysed the correlation of heavy metal pollution with the C- and Cx-values assigned to the test plots. The method of probability analysis was a hypergeometric distribution method. We confirm, on a different methodological basis than previously, that along the pollution gradient, species with high C- and Cx-values are increasingly underrepresented. This lends support to the “large genome constraint hypothesis”, predicting that plants with large genomes are at a disadvantage under all aspects of evolution, ecology, and phenotype, because junk DNA imposes a load to the organism.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Our large-scale survey of genomic nucleotide composition across monocots has enabled the first rigorous testing, to our knowledge, of its biological significance in plants. We show that genomic DNA base composition (GC content) is significantly associated with genome size and holocentric chromosomal structure. GC content may also have deep ecological relevance, because changes in GC content may have played a significant role in the evolution of Earth’s biota, especially the rise of grass-dominated biomes during the mid-Tertiary. The discovery of several groups with very unusual GC contents highlights the need for in-depth analysis to uncover the full extent of genomic diversity. Furthermore, our stratified sampling method of distribution data and quantile regression-like logic of phylogenetic analyses may find wider applications in the analysis of spatially heterogeneous data.
          , 
            Genomic DNA base composition (GC content) is predicted to significantly affect genome functioning and species ecology. Although several hypotheses have been put forward to address the biological impact of GC content variation in microbial and vertebrate organisms, the biological significance of GC content diversity in plants remains unclear because of a lack of sufficiently robust genomic data. Using flow cytometry, we report genomic GC contents for 239 species representing 70 of 78 monocot families and compare them with genomic characters, a suite of life history traits and climatic niche data using phylogeny-based statistics. GC content of monocots varied between 33.6\% and 48.9\%, with several groups exceeding the GC content known for any other vascular plant group, highlighting their unusual genome architecture and organization. GC content showed a quadratic relationship with genome size, with the decreases in GC content in larger genomes possibly being a consequence of the higher biochemical costs of GC base synthesis. Dramatic decreases in GC content were observed in species with holocentric chromosomes, whereas increased GC content was documented in species able to grow in seasonally cold and/or dry climates, possibly indicating an advantage of GC-rich DNA during cell freezing and desiccation. We also show that genomic adaptations associated with changing GC content might have played a significant role in the evolution of the Earth’s contemporary biota, such as the rise of grass-dominated biomes during the mid-Tertiary. One of the major selective advantages of GC-rich DNA is hypothesized to be facilitating more complex gene regulation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A multivariate quantitative genetic model is analyzed that is based on the assumption that the genetic variation at a locus j primarily influences an underlying physiological variable yj, while influence on the genotypic values is determined by a kind of "developmental function" which is not changed by mutations at this locus. Assuming additivity among loci the developmental function becomes a linear transformation of the underlying variables y onto the genotypic values x, x = By. In this way the pleiotropic effects become constrained by the structure of the B-matrix. The equilibrium variance under mutation-stabilizing selection balance in infinite and finite populations is derived by using the house of cards approximation. The results are compared to the predictions given by M. Turelli in 1985 for pleiotropic two-character models. It is shown that the B-matrix model gives the same results as Turelli's five-allele model, suggesting that the crucial factor determining the equilibrium variance in multivariate models with pleiotropy is the assumption about constraints on the pleiotropic effects, and not the number of alleles as proposed by Turelli. Finally it is shown that under Gaussian stabilizing selection the structure of the B-matrix has effectively no influence on the mean equilibrium fitness of an infinite population. Hence the B-matrix and consequently to some extent also the structure of the genetic correlation matrix is an almost neutral character. The consequences for the evolution of genetic covariance matrices are discussed.},

	abstract = {The control of gaseous exchange between the leaf and external atmosphere is governed by stomatal conductance ( g
              s
              ); therefore, stomata play a critical role in photosynthesis and transpiration and overall plant productivity. Stomatal conductance is determined by both anatomical features and behavioral characteristics. Here we review some of the osmoregulatory pathways in guard cell metabolism, genes and signals that determine stomatal function and patterning, and the recent work that explores coordination between g
              s
              and carbon assimilation ( A) and the influence of spatial distribution of functional stomata on underlying mesophyll anatomy. We also evaluate the current literature on mesophyll-driven signals that may coordinate stomatal behavior with mesophyll carbon assimilation and explore stomatal kinetics as a possible target to improve A and water use efficiency. By understanding these processes, we can start to provide insight into manipulation of these regulatory pathways to improve stomatal behavior and identify novel unexploited targets for altering stomatal behavior and improving crop plant productivity.},
