% Line numbering
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Please use line numbering with your initial submission and
% subsequent revisions. After acceptance, please turn line numbering
% off by adding percent signs to the lines %\usepackage{lineno} and
% to %\linenumbers{} and %\modulolinenumbers[3] below.
%
% To avoid line numbering being thrown off around math environments,
% the math environments have to be wrapped using
% \begin{linenomath*} and \end{linenomath*}

% Authorship
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Please remove authorship information while your paper is under review,

% will need to add this information back in to your final files after
% acceptance.

% Once accepted for publication, author-supplied PDFs should have a 
% title page that includes (at least) the authors' names, the title of 
% the MS, and the name of the journal. It should also have a header and
% page numbers.
