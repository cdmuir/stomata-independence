IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 64 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.


A mixed model file with model assignments for undetermined
columns removed has already been printed to  file ../../alignments/Bromus_4501_outpart.reduced
An alignment file with undetermined columns removed has already
been printed to file ../../alignments/Bromus_4501_outaln_names1.reduced

Alignment has 64 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data

Alignment has 1482 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 71.70%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 6 distinct models/data partitions with individual per partition branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
