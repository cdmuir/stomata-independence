IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Stipa_iberica and Stipa_cazorlensis are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Stipa_ukranensis and Stipa_pontica are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 106 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.


Just in case you might need it, a mixed model file with 
model assignments for undetermined columns removed is printed to file ../../alignments/Stipa_15869_outpart.reduced
Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file ../../alignments/Stipa_15869_outaln_names1.reduced

Alignment has 106 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data

Alignment has 1268 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 69.83%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 11 distinct models/data partitions with individual per partition branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
