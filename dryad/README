DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

File List: <list all files (or folders, as appropriate for dataset organization) contained in the dataset, with a brief description>

stomatal-anatomy.csv - raw stomatal anatomical data from ropenstomata
stomatal-anatomy-metadata.csv - metadata on raw stomatal anatomical data from ropenstomata
plant-c-value.csv - raw data on plant C-value downloaded from the Angiosperm DNA C-values database
trimmed-data.csv - trimmed data set of species found on phylogeny
trimmed-phylogeny.new - trimmed phylogeny of species with stomatal anatomical data in newick format
phylogenetic-contrasts.csv - phylogenetically independent contrasts used in final analyses

Relationship between files: 

  The column "resolved_name" in trimmed-data.csv matches the tip names in trimmed-phylogeny.new. 
  
  The column "tree_node" in phylogenetic-contrasts.csv refers to the node in trimmed-phylogeny.new
  
  The columns "sp1" and "sp2" match "resolved_name" in trimmed-data.csv matches the tip names in trimmed-phylogeny.new
